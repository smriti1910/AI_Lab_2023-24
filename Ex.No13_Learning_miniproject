### REGISTER NUMBER : 212221040156
### AIM: 
To write a program to train the classifier for reccommendation system thta recommends books based on user ratings.
###  Algorithm:
1. Load data, create user-item matrix, calculate user similarity using cosine similarity.
2. Predict ratings for target user based on similar user ratings.
3. Filter out rated books, select top N recommendations with highest predicted ratings.
### Program:
# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load a small subset of the dataset
ratings = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/master/samples/ratings.csv')
books = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k/master/samples/books.csv')

# Data preprocessing
# For simplicity, we'll keep only the relevant columns
ratings = ratings[['user_id', 'book_id', 'rating']]

# Implement Collaborative Filtering
# Create user-item matrix
user_item_matrix = ratings.pivot_table(index='user_id', columns='book_id', values='rating').fillna(0)

# Calculate user similarity using cosine similarity
user_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_item_matrix)

# Generate recommendations for a target user (e.g., user with ID 1)
target_user_id = 1
similarities = user_similarity[target_user_id - 1]
predicted_ratings = similarities.dot(user_item_matrix.values) / similarities.sum()

# Convert predicted ratings into DataFrame
recommendations = pd.DataFrame(predicted_ratings.reshape(1, -1), columns=user_item_matrix.columns)

# Filter out books that the user has already rated
already_rated = ratings[ratings['user_id'] == target_user_id]['book_id']
recommendations = recommendations.drop(already_rated, axis=1)

# Get top N recommendations
top_n = 5
top_recommendations = recommendations.iloc[0].nlargest(top_n)

# Print top recommendations
print("Top {} Recommendations for User {}: \n".format(top_n, target_user_id))
for book_id, predicted_rating in top_recommendations.items():
    book_title = books.loc[books['book_id'] == book_id, 'title'].iloc[0]
    print("Book ID: {}, Title: {}, Predicted Rating: {:.2f}".format(book_id, book_title, predicted_rating))

### Output:

Top 5 Recommendations for User 1: 

Book ID: 2, Title: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1), Predicted Rating: 0.00
Book ID: 5, Title: The Great Gatsby, Predicted Rating: 0.00
Book ID: 8, Title: The Catcher in the Rye, Predicted Rating: 0.00
Book ID: 13, Title: 1984, Predicted Rating: 0.00
Book ID: 14, Title: Animal Farm, Predicted Rating: 0.00

### Result:
Thus the system was trained successfully and the prediction was carried out.
